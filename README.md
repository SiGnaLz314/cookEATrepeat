# cookEATrepeat

This is just to hold the recipes and present them as plain HTML with minimal JavaScript.

These recipes, and their accompanying pictures, will form the core set of recipes for a React app which will enable users to add their own recipes (that functionality is being worked on in a separate GitHub repository, [https://github.com/SiGnaLz314/cookEatRepeat_Node]).
